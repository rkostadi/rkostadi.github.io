  I am a computational cancer biologist. 
Currently, I am doing research on epigenetics of leukemia working with Patrick Brown and Robert Scharpf. I collaborate with Pediatric Genomic Medicine at Children's Mercy Kansas City.
  I obtained my PhD from the Genomics and Computational Biology program at the University of Pennsylvania with Carlo Maley. During my PhD I worked on analyzing evolutionary dynamics of neoplastic cell populations in Barrettâ€™s Esophagus. I have written software for DNA copy number data analysis, SNP array data analysis, phylogenetic analysis, RNA sequencing data analysis, DNA bisulfite sequencing data analysis, and spatial stochastic tumor evolution simulation. I use C++, Java, Emacs, shell scripting, R, and any other tools to get the job done.
